    "summary": "Record samples of sweeps (linear and exponential), white noise, and speech for the validation of DOA algorithms. The 48 microphones pyramic array is mounted atop a turntable, the three loud speakers are placed between 3.5 and 4m away at three different heights. The array is rotated anticlockwise in increments of 2 degrees 180 times, giving us a full circle.",
    "notes": [
      "Bugs with the USB interface crashed the computer several times and the measurements were thus taken by batch. The batches are the following. Batch 1: Angles 0 to 14. Batch 2: 16 to 180. Batch 3: 182 to 190. Batch 4: 192 to 206. Batch 5: 208 to 216. Batch 6: 218 to 358.",
      "During quality control a glitch in recording at angle 310 with spkr 0 was found and the measurement was repeated on the next morning, but before the setup was moved. When the measurement was repeated, the temperature was 21.6C and the humidity 48.9%. The glitched sample is preserved in the 'discarded' directory.",
      "The angles `alpha_raw` in the raw measurement names corresponds to anti-clockwise rotation of the array. Thus, the sources move clockwise with respect to the array. In the segmented files, the angle `alpha_seg` in the name is the angle the source moved with respect to the array, that is `alpha_seg = (360 - alpha_raw) mod 360`."
